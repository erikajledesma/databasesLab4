# CS3750 Database Systems Lab 4 by Erika Ledesma and Alison Fung
## A program ran through the terminal that implements the Pomona Transit System.
## Postgres and JDBC were used to create a system where users can:
- view the schedule of all trips for a given start and end location
- edit the schedule by deleting a trip offering, adding a set of trip offerings, changing the driver for a given trip or changing the bus
- display the stops of a given trip
- display the weekly schedule of a given driver and date
- add a drive
- add a bus
- delete a bus
- record actual data of a given trip
